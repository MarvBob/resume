    summary: >
      As a AQ manager for Spirtech, my role is to supervise and manage my team (4 people) while participating interne
      technical tasks.
      We perform expertise missions and tests for external clients but also all the quality assurance process for
      everything that is developped internally.
      We try to automate tests as much as we can by using home made testing tools (Python) allowing us to perform pre-written
      scenarios (TestLink).
      Those tools interface with differents objects such as servers, databases, smart cards, mobile phones, and are in constant evolution.
    highlights:
      - Development, evolution and maintenance of testing tools (Python).
      - Development and set up of the quality assurance process.
      - Tests of standards conformity compliance for external clients.

      My internship at Withings consisted in a study of feasability for sleep apnea detection using the

      an analysis method to detect sleep apneas.
